***DESCRIPTION***
The test_ThingPerson program prints and records four records in JSON key pair format tracking the movement of the
Persons (instructor, John, Tiffany),
Things (bus, personal computer, android device),
and GPS locations (Everson Hall, Silo, 8th and J Street stop, Moore and Pollock stop),
at the specific times (6:00, 6:10, 6:20, 6:32 pms) of the quoted story:

"The ecs36b lecture on Wednesday, April 12 of 2023 ended at 6 pm in the room 176 of Everson Hall at
UC Davis. The instructor took the Unitrans L line from the Silo Station, leaving at 6:10 pm, and the bus
driver was a Psychology student named Tiffany. On the same bus, there was another ecs36b student,
John. John asked the instructor some questions about homework assignment #2 (using his own
computer), before he got off the bus at the 8th and J Street stop at 6:20 pm on the same date. After John
being off the bus, the instructor started playing an online game on an Android device. The instructor said
“thank you” to the bus driver, Tiffany, before he himself got off at the Moore and Pollock stop at 6:32
pm."

After this, the program converts the four records into .JSON files. These files are converted back into C++ objects.
